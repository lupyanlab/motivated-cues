* Again, a major question in this research is whether the conceptual activation from a nonlinguistic sound is the same as the conceptual activation from a linguistic sound ( i.e., a word ).
* Is there a discrepancy here - that is, in the use of ERP with a known *language* negative wave (N400) to answer the question of conceptual similarity?
* If the N400 is a measure of a prediction error, does that change any of these interpretations?
- ERP N400 'violations' - visual, auditory sentences and word lists; famous faces categorized by occupation; violations in familiar melodies; 
	* These are hard pressed to be explained completely within the "language-specific" view of the N400
- basic lateralization claim is that - though they are behaviorally similar - processing of speech is left-lateralized, and processing of non speed is right-lateralized
	- supported by left/right dichotic listening advantages

Exp 1:
- listen to sound/word pair and indicate if the word was an actual word or a nonword ( actual words varied in relatedness to the semantics of the sound )
- participants were 89 msec faster to respond to related pairs than to unrelated pairs

Exp 2:
- listen to sound/word pair, then listen to a fragment of the second sound and respond if the fragment was a part of the original pair
- varied the order ( sound/word versus word/sound ) 
- larger N400 for unrelated sound / words, qualitatively similar to unrelated words in sentences
- larger N400 for unrelated words / sounds, but right-lateralized}

REV: Van Petten {\&}amp; Rheinfelder (1995) hearing a conceptually related sound lead to faster and more accurate identification of a word than when the word was unrelated to the sound ( or a pseudo word )
REV: Orgs et al. (2006) follow up to van Petter {\&}amp; Rheinfelder; faster RTs for related sounds/words.
[Lebrun et al. (2001) - common semantic system for words and sounds, but "with more specific perceptual processing for the latter"]
[Schon, Ystad, Kronland-Martinet {\&}amp; Bensson (2009) - cross-modal priming with nonnameable sounds still produced relatedness advantages]

- Goals: Use nonlinguistic and homogenous sounds ( impact sounds from wood, metal, or glass )

Exp. 1
- Methods: sound tweening!!; Norming study - participants identified the sound as wood/metal/glass

Conclusions:
- Support for similarity {\&}gt; differences in linguistic and nonlinguistic auditory processing
- Found comparable "ambiguity" effects for words and non words ( tweened impact sounds ) in a same-different discrimination task
- Similarities in the two tasks suggest that linguistic mediation is not necessary}

- N400 spike indicates semantic violation, and the fact that the N400 spike occurs when a word is preceded by an unrelated sound suggests that there is some underlying semantic similarity in the two cases
- A lot of effort is put into the acoustic features of the sound in an attempt to isolate "source-less" sounds ( e.g., meaned on balance: 'maintenance' and 'mass' )
- Procedure: Normed the ambiguous sounds by asking people to free respond, and then chose the words that had identical or semantically close words for 3 of the 7 participants were considered related pairs.

Exp. 1 Results: When attending the audio ( e.g. 'dog [bark]?' ), there was a larger benefit for visual congruency than when attending the visual ( e.g., 'dog [picture]?' ). However, when the pictures were reduced in contrast, this effect went away - making a reliable interaction. There was no interaction with delay, suggesting that the difference is not due to time of processing constraints.
Exp. 2 Results: General replication of Exp. 1 with the prime following the presentation of the stimuli now presented auditory ( rather than visually ).

General discussion: Information in an unattended modality can facilitate processing in an attended modality. The interaction with the effects of contrast reveal that priority is placed on the most informative ( least noisy ) cues rather than some rigid modality-specific hierarchy.

- depends on the modularity assumption and the transparency assumption
- transparency assumption: the assumption that it will be transparent what is damaged
- subtractivity assumption: the performance of the system as a whole is the performance of the system as it was before the damage less the damaged components (almost the complement of the transparency assumption)
- poor performance: not simple a disruption of normal processing, but a "particular pattern of poor performance" (p. 13)
- advocates for more exhaustive analyses of case studies
- I believe replication is a way to distinguish between the different reasons for poor performance, but without relegating to the neurology of the patient, we have no way to determine what is going on
- the assumption of homogeneity is critical to group studies - that all patients in a group have the same set of impairments and "survival" abilities
- psychologically strong versus weak notions of a syndrome; used as criteria for grouping sets of patients; we cannot group patients based on weak syndromes because there is no way to make sure the underlying disorders are the same
- weak syndrome does not require the fractionation assumption to be true; because exhibiting the weak syndrome does not reflect discrete damage to the underlying system}

volume = {5},

pages = {41--66},
annote = {- Caramazza evaluates the rational basis for supporting cognitive theory through empirical data
- a positive is that Caramazza does accurately point out that many scientists are unaware of the problems and unspoken assumptions underlying much of what they do
- Caramazza argues that fully addressing the problems and assumptions supports conclusions about cognitive theory observed in single case studies rather than group studies
- goal of cognitive neuropsychology is to only understand the functional architecture
- {\ldots}"computationally explicit accounts of the input/output relationship for specific cognitive systems" (p. 43). 
- in fact, he assumes it without even supporting the argument
- this approach makes the relationship between theory and evidence paramount
- seems to advocate a lot for explicit explanation{\ldots}
- the reason for saying that modules in single patients are either on or off is because variations in performance do not reflect computationally distinct processes.
	- for example, reading RT could be influenced by word frequency and structure, but these factors exist apart from any functional architecture of how reading actually happens. Therefore, we should only care about yes/no performance.
- I think a really basic problem with this approach is that the type of evidence considered relevant is not theory-independent
- another issue - aside from theory-independence - is the assumption of universality, that prior to damage all functional architectures are the same
- assumption of universality means that we randomly sample and average a population to reflect the average individual drawn from that population
	- is this true though? Aren't there instances where we average not to simulate an average individual?
- transparency assumption - the functional architecture of a brain-damaged patient is the functional architecture of a normal participant less the local modification to the functional architecture
- however, by only being interested in the functional architecture, we can no longer assume that there is any reason to equate patient 1 with any patient 2 unless we had reason to prove that the two patients were identical in all theoretically relevant respects - yet at this point we gain nothing by grouping them together (since that proof comes through behavior)
- group studies can only answer statistical questions (probability of behavioral concurrence) 
- necessity of concurrence can be disproven in a single case-study
- replicability problem - there is theoretical replicability such that patients must not emit behavior contrary to previously formulated theory; this leads to endless splitting of cognitive models!
- responds that any noise will be canceled out with time, but it's not clear

{\#}{\#}{\#}
single/double dissociations
- trivial truth - more information is better
- double dissociations do not provide any more information that two single dissociations}

Phenomenon: sounds in many ways behave like words
	- frequency effects, priming of related sounds

Cognitive neuropsychology:
	- damage
	- double dissociation
	- yet plenty of evidence that the severity of language comprehension goes hand-in-hand with environmental sound recognition

(1) Explanation: "linguistic processing could be mediating the identification of environmental sounds"
	- hear a dog bark -{\&}gt; think "dog" -{\&}gt; then say "dog"

Description of task:
Condition 1: Covert naming
Condition 2: Non-naming
	- varied within subject
	- distractor relatedness

Task:
	two line drawings (related or unrelated) appeared for 1000msec
	then an auditory cue was played / environmental sound only
	decide which (left/right) the sound matched

Prediction 1: "If subvocal rehearsal, then less accurate in the non-naming condition, and equivalent reaction times in both conditions for accurately named items"
Prediction B: "If not subvocal rehearsal, then increased reaction times in the naming condition, because it's an extra task"

Results:
	Mean reaction times longer for the Naming condition (1264) than for the non-naming condition.
	Subjects responded more slowly to distractor pairs than unrelated pairs

Caveats:
(individual differences) - what I call task confounds - in covert naming/non-naming

- There is a relationship between predictions and priors in cases of light coming from above (Adams et al., 2004) or slow motion speeds (Weiss, et al. 2002). 
- authors divide perceptual and cognitive prediction errors from motivational prediction errors. The former are related to surprise at unexpected presentation, the latter attach a valence of reward to the content of the error
- a key interpretation of the oddball paradigms - and the resulting mismatch negativity electrophysiological response - is that the MMN is a result of violated prediction, not of a simple change in the stimulus
- one way to understand the unity assumption is speech is that we predict speech to come out when we see someone's lips moving
- surprise responses are not generic, but have representational content (Peelen {\&}amp; Kastner, 2011); how does this relate to ToM?
- prediction is really a measure of efficiency. Prediction errors cause spikes in activity because it takes more "effort" to process the stimuli. When things are expected, they can be integrated into the "world view" very easily.
- another (equivalent?) distinction in terms of prediction is the time scale. Cognitive/perceptual prediction errors facilitate short term effects of inference, whereas motivation prediction errors facilitate long term learning and integration.
- "attention is the optimization of predictive precision" (Friston, 2009; Feldman {\&}amp; Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2012); attention "boosts" prediction errors related to current expectations}

- Goals: Use nonlinguistic and homogenous sounds ( impact sounds from wood, metal, or glass )

Exp. 1
- Methods: sound tweening!!; Norming study - participants identified the sound as wood/metal/glass

Conclusions:
- Support for similarity {\&}gt; differences in linguistic and nonlinguistic auditory processing
- Found comparable "ambiguity" effects for words and non words ( tweened impact sounds ) in a same-different discrimination task
- Similarities in the two tasks suggest that linguistic mediation is not necessary}

Extradimensional shift - an additional or different dimension is now the basis for the categorization

* the very fact that intradimensional shifts are easier than extra dimensional shifts is telling: categorization relies on location-independency ( reword )
* an alternate experiment would be to perform an extra dimensional shift going from a nameable dimension to a non-nameable dimension

- Kendler (1964) - verbalizing the relevant values caused subjects to be more likely to perform the reversal shift
- Kendler and Kendler (1959) - fast learners solved the reversal problem more quickly, and slow learners solved the ED problem more quickly.

- Bogartz (1965) - "dimension-less" categorizes still exhibit a reversal learning advantage
	- labels are not necessary to bring about the reversal shift advantage

Biases in comparing ID and ED:
(1) Set overlap in ID and ED - some items will remain on the same side in ED, but all will be switched in ID
(2) Detecting the change is easier with an ID switch than an ED switch ( see (1) above )
*focus on dimensional ( abstract ) mediators, not category specific ( concrete ) mediators

Different designs ( basic, optional shift, and partial change ) suffer from critical weaknesses that inhibit strong conclusions about the mediation hypothesis ( that the reason RV {\&}gt; ED is due to a verbal label of the dimension that must be "broken" in ED ) 

* the experiment proposed acknowledges these biases and looks specifically at the RV case: where the only variation is the salience of the mediator ( varied by instruction )

Author concludes that the total change design ( new stimuli at "switch" ) is the best design to test the difference between ED and ID}

Philosophical arguments about extended cognition often focus on the contents of the cognitive state, Chalmers and Clark's parity principle being the biggest example -- If something out in the word is serving an equivalent function to a mental state, than that mental state is extended to the environment. Gallagher takes a slightly different take: what makes the socially extended mind is not about content, but about the dynamism and collectivism embodied in social interactions and institutions. He seems to like using the courtroom as an example of a place where collective mental states convene even if no single person has (or could have?) all of the knowledge in the system.}

	- these obey the same laws as overt responses
	- verbal labels for stimulus dimensions (Kendler {\&}amp; Kendler, 1962; Eckstrang {\&}amp; Wickens, 1954) or verbal labels for cues within a dimension (Kendler, 1960; Lachman {\&}amp; Sanders, 1963) which either act as the cue (Kendler {\&}amp; D'Amato, 1955) or function to orient the participant to the relevant dimension (Kendler, 1964)

Compositionality: strongly associated "percepts", such as noses and eyes, always appear together. The presence of one predicts the presence of the other. Also, it is impossible to selectively attend to one. A different way to put it: do we have holistic processing for actions/mental states?}
